# Parallel-Corpora-and-LMs

Project for the Computational Linguistics Class of 2024-b semester. 

Given a small corpus from Europarl, I have
1. Preprocessed the json file
2. Trained a total of four character-level Statistical Language Models using the LM class
3. Compute the perplexity of four models on different sentences



Steps to run the files are :

preprocessing - Training-  perplexity - calculation
